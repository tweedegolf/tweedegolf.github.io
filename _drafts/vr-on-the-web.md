Ever since the concept of virtual reality was conceived somewhere at the
beginning of the 19th century, many companies have tried to create devices that
allow us to explore a new world. Only recently however has technology catched up
with that idea. With the introduction of devices such as the [Oculus Rift] and
the [HTC Vive] we can for the first time experience other worlds as if we were
in them.

One problem with these devices is accessibility however. You're required to have
a relatively specific set of hardware and software for it to work properly.
Fortunately we're also getting new VR efforts from companies as Google (with
their [Cardboard] and [Daydream] platforms) and Samsung (with the [GearVR]).
They introduce cheaper and more accessible VR solutions.

This is where the web can help: as an inexpensive and widely accessible platform
it would be well suited for making VR more mainstream. As it happens, [WebVR]
is actually well on it's way to make it into some browsers. While currently only
available in preview versions of some browsers, it does have definite potential.
Since the [first time we looked at WebVR] a lot of progress has been made by
browser vendors to support virtual reality!

Imagine browsing the web and being able to quickly jump into VR to view that
new property development. Or taking a look around that couch before buying it.
Or just playing a quick game in VR without having to download a large
application. There are many new ways to allow interaction when using VR, and the
web may just make them available for many.
