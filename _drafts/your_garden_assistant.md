In 2014 we won an innovation grant from the province of Gelderland based on our proposal to create 'intelligent' advice for the users of the gardening related [Draw Your Garden](http://tekenjetuin.nl), a website we made previously and have been gradually expanding for the last few years. Draw Your Garden is a website were users can design their garden, view it in 3D, order different products and even contact gardeners that can submit proposals based on the users design.

Together with Draw Your Garden, we proposed to develop a number of prototypes aimed at assisting the users on serveral areas, which hitherto required much expert-knowledge. Appropriatly, we named this project 'Your GardenAssistant'. 

For the project we focused on three areas of garden design:

* **Advice on watering a garden**; placing different kinds of sprinklers, what kind of plants need more water, which types of sprinklers are suited to different parts of the garden and how sprinklers should be connected to what kinds of water source.
* **The presence and influence of sunlight and shadow in the garden**; to show which areas of the garden receive the most light in different seasons and parts of the day, where to place a terrace and where to plant different sorts of plant. 
* **Advice on the properties of plants and trees;** which plants would prosper in different parts of the garden, how many plants flower per month, what plants are edible or poisonous.

###Approach

The first thing we realised was that, as almost none of us even has a garden, it would be crucial to involve different kinds of experts, gardeners and users in the project. To compensate for our own lack of knowledge we decided to involve experts and users from the very start of the project, and to check back with them frequently to decide how to proceed.
