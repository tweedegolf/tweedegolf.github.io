The history of virtual reality (VR) dates back to the 1950's. Since then, a lot of sometimes quite exotic devices have been developed. For instance take a look at this VR cabinet called "sensorama" developed by Morton Heilig in 1962:

Nowadays, most VR devices take the form of head mounted devices (HMD). Probably the best known example of such a device is the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/). The device looks a bit like safety goggles.

For each eye the Oculus has a full hd display and the 3D content (for instance a game or a video) is rendered in stereo. This means that the image on the left display is taken from a slightly different angle compared to the image on the right display. This difference is analogous to the distance between our two eyes. A set of specially shaped lenses turn this stereo image into one an image that we perceive as a single spacious view, or as seemingly real.

Furthermore, the Oculus has a lot of sensors that track the rotation of the device, your position and the velocity of your movements. The generated data is used to adjust the images that are rendered to the displays so you can for instance look around in a 3D scene as if you are actually standing inside that scene.

Besides the Oculus there are numerous other companies that have made or announced HDM's for VR. You can roughly divide them into two categories: 1) devices that have to be connected to a computer, and 2) devices that work with a mobile phone.

The Oculus is of the first category; it needs a computer for rendering the right content based on the data generated by the sensors. Basically the Oculus acts as another monitor of your computer.

Googles Cardboard is an example of the second category, the phone's gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer are used to track the rotation and position, and the 3D content gets rendered by the phone itself.

Advantage of the first category is that you have more processing power for rendering the 3D content, advantage of the latter category is that you are not tied by wires to your computer.

At Tweede Golf we are currently researching how we can use VR together with our [3D framework](http://tweedegolf.nl/3d-framework/), and therefor we have acquired both an Oculus Rift and a Google Cardboard. In the coming blog posts we will share with you the results of this research.
